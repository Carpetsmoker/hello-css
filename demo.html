<h1 id="hello-css">Hello, CSS!</h1>
<p>Hello CSS! is a CSS template which styles most elements to neutral and
aesthetically pleasing defaults. I copy/pasted variants of this so often I
figured I might as well put a cleaned up and annotated version somewhere.</p>
<p>I encourage you to pick ’n choose what you need, rather than insert everything.
<a href="https://arp242.net/weblog/web-documents.html">I also encourage you to put it in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> block rather than external
files</a>.</p>
<h2 id="design-principles">Design principles</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Good typography can help your reader devote less attention to the mechanics of
reading and more attention to your message. Conversely, bad typography can
distract your reader and undermine your message.</p>
<p>—Matthew Butterick, <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/"><em>Practical Typography</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Pleasant defaults that should work well for most websites.</li>
<li>Text and good typography dominates.</li>
<li>Simplicity matters; easy to extend or modify.</li>
<li>Works on all browser, assistive technology, and screen sizes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>There are several files. Mix-and-match as you want. The <a href="demo.html">demo.html</a>
file includes just <code>base.css</code>, and <a href="demo-fancy.html">demo-fancy.html</a> includes
all files.</p>
<p>There are no classes; only element selectors are used. The files are brief and
well annotated, and a number of styles have commented-out alternatives. I
encourage you to read and modify to your preference, rather than blindly
copy/paste.</p>
<p>Not every last element is styled. For some things – such as &lt;abbr&gt; it&#39;s
fine to rely on the browser defaults, small differences are okay.
Other things – such as forms – tend to be quite application-specific and is a
bit outside of the scope of this project, as the main goal is for text websites,
not interactive ones.</p>
<p>Feel free to open an issue if you’re missing something in particular.</p>
